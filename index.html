<p><strong>San Diego School, California —</strong> The San Diego School football team secured a spot in the state finals by winning 22-14 against Riverside High School at San Diego School Stadium on Sunday, December 14th, making school history.</p>

<p>In a game where the air was tense with excitement, the San Diego Wolves dominated both offensively and defensively. Quarterback Abbas Absi led the charge with two touchdown passes, while center Ray Alrifaey contributed a powerful 110-yard run, sealing the win for the Wolves.</p>

<p>Coach Moe Kousie praised the team's effort, saying, "The players showed incredible focus, teamwork, and form today. This victory is the result of months of hard work, dedication, and training."</p>

<p>Fans packed the stands, cheering loudly throughout the match. Hardcore Wolve's fan Zayd Sinsikriti reflected on the match: "They were so good, I don't think anyone can stop them now! I still can't believe Ray's heroic performance. Riverside was tough, but that final game next week should be super easy after this. We already won, basically!"</p>

<p>Looking ahead, the Wolves will face off against Valley High School in the state finals next weekend. The team is preparing rigorously and aims to bring home the championship trophy for San Diego School.</p>

<p>With their spot in the finals secured, the San Diego School football team has set the stage for an exciting battle to decide their season. Ultimate team or lucky flop? Fans and students alike are patiently waiting to find out.</p>
